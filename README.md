This is a very simple Windows PowerShell program that sends hex values to a Russound CAS amplifier over a USB to serial adapter.
The ugly gui contains basic functionality for independently controlling the input, volume, bass and treble of 4 zones.

This is the one and only program I've written and I don't have a clue what I'm doing so some changes such as the COM port may need adjusting to function 
but I've tried to label my work to make that easier.






Feel free to do whatever you want with this progarm besides make money, unless I get a cut.
